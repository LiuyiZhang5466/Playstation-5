    "parameter": "When PlayStation launched in Japan in 1994 (and the rest of the world in 1995), it redefined home console gaming.\n\nPlayStation games were the first to be released on CD and boasted advanced 3D polygon graphics and the ability to save your games with a removable 128k memory card. Within a decade, PlayStation became the first games console in history to sell more than 100 million units worldwide and, during its entire lifespan, had almost 8,000 games available to play.\n"
